COMMANDS USED:

scrapy crawl spiderWiki -o billboard1.csv
scrapy crawl spiderBillboard -o billboard2.csv
python3 cleanup.py 
scrapy crawl spiderSong -o songs.csv




PROCESS:

spiderWiki.py contains 3 crawlers, which are used to first build database of years of lists of billboard songs and their links (spiderWiki),
then to build a database of songs in each year and links to each song (spiderBillboard), and then to build a final database of songs and information about them (spiderSong)

Before creating the final database we use cleanup.py to fix not functional links or errors in names, as well as removing songs that occurr multiple times and just adding a count of occurences column



STRUCTURES OF TABLES:

billboard1.csv - year,era,pre-2012,url 
billboard2.csv - title,artist,year,era,url
songs.csv - title,artist,count,year of release,genre,length



VISUALIZATIONS/CONCLUSIONS:
1 - Overall number of occurences in Billboard per genre (top 20 genres)
2 - Median duration of songs on Billboard over the years
3 - Top 20 artists with most occurences on Billboard
4 - Duration of songs per genre
5 - Popularity of genres by year of release
